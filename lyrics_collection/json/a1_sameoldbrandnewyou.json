You know it doesn't turn me on)               Brand new day (Ben - You're singing that same old song)               No more lies (Ben - If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)                 Another night, another day               What can I say               You're still the same old brand new you               You break your promises in two               What can I do               When you're the same old brand new you                 You'll change, you'll never change               You're never never gonna keep your promises x 2                 Because of you, I guess we're through               Is this the way it has to be               I've been a fool (Ben -
