You\'re never never gonna keep your promises x 2                 You said you\'d change               But I\'m afraid               It\'s something I won\'t live to see               It\'s seems so strange               That sometimes fate               Can appear to be so real               And yet turn out to be a fantasy                 Same old line, one more time               Say you\'re
